This script checks CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of the metrics exceed predefined thresholds, it sends an alert to the console and writes it to a log file.
1. Imports:
a) psutil is used to get system information such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.
b) logging is used to log alerts to a file.
c) datetime is used to timestamp the logs.

2. Thresholds:
a) Set the CPU, memory, and disk usage thresholds.

3. Logging Configuration:

a) Logs are saved to system_health.log.

4. Functions:
a) check_cpu_usage(): Checks the CPU usage and logs an alert if it exceeds the threshold.
b) check_memory_usage(): Checks the memory usage and logs an alert if it exceeds the threshold.
c) check_disk_usage(): Checks the disk usage and logs an alert if it exceeds the threshold.
d) check_running_processes(): Logs the number of running processes.

4. Main Loop:
a) Continuously checks system health every 60 seconds.

Running the Script:
Save the script to a file, e.g., system_health_monitor.py.
Run the script using Python: python system_health_monitor.py.
Make sure to install the psutil library if it's not already installed by running:
This script will monitor the system's health and log any alerts to both the console and a log file.
